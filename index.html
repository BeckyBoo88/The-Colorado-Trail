                You're at the start of the trail bright eyed and bushy tailed.  You look at the trail information marker to see what you're getting into.  It says the trail is only 8 miles but there is a warning to not go if you aren't prepared.  They recommend going in a group and to make sure you have plenty of water. What would you like to do?

                You break out as a “true” adventurer and hit the trail alone.  You take in the beautiful scenery and are truly captivated by the beauty of the back country. You come to a fork in the road and have two options:
            </p>
            <div class="buttonHolder">
                 <button id='solo1'>You head right, it’s a bit longer but the promise of breath-taking views and bit more technical hiking is too hard to resist.</button>
                 <button id='solo2'>You go left.  The trail isn’t as long but it’s more heavily wooded and the promise of shade from the rising sun is calling to you.</button>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div id='soloOption1'>
            <p id='sOption1'>
                You are loving your choice.  The trail hasn’t been well maintained but the views are even better than you could have imagined.  You’re staring up at the largest and most majestic bald eagle, you’re about to take a picture worth of National Geographic and fail to notice the prairie dog hole in your path.  As you snap the picture you also happen to snap your ankle! A park ranger finds you and calls for air rescue to get you out.  You are no Lewis or Clark! FAIL!

                You thank God that you took the heavily wooded shorter trail.  As the day goes forward, it’s only getting hotter.  You think to yourself that next time you’ll need to start sooner to avoid the heat.  The trees get denser and it starts to feel a bit eerie.  Almost like you’re being watched… <br>
                Next thing you know you're getting eaten butt first by a mountain lion!  Those silly apex predators.  You earned your Darwin Award on the Colorado Trail!

                You decided that a true adventure is even better with friends. So, you decide to wait the hour for them to arrive. Your two besties show up and in the back of their jeep they have some extra water bottles for everyone.  The only thing is they’re not cold and they’re going to add weight to your backs...
            </p>
            <div class="buttonHolder">
                 <button id='friends1'>You decide the little bit of extra weight is worth it just in case you get thirsty.  It is a little warm out.</button>
                 <button id='friends2'> It's only 8 miles and extra weight means extra effort.  Just hit the trail with what you guys have in your hydration reservoirs in your backpacks.</button>

                You’re so happy that you made the choice to wait for your friends.  You all get to see some of the most breath-taking views, take some great pictures, and share the most amazing moment ever when Billy slipped and fell into the river when ya’ll decided to break for a while. <br /> You all made it back to the cars and had a great day.  Congratulations! You made it on the Colorado Trail!!

                You guys hit the trail and are loving all animals and gorgeous scenery. You hit the midway point and realize you’ve run out of water.  You didn’t think it’d happen so quickly but luckily you come across a river.  You guys make the collective decision that the water looks clear and clean so you fill up your hydration backs with fresh mountain water and continue on.  You think you heard a low growl and turn to tell your friends to keep their eyes open for animals.  They look like hell and one is panicking trying to get off the trail before he poops his pants. That cool mountain water gave all of you dysentery! <br /> Lucky for you guys a park ranger finds you all in heaping messes of misery and poop.  He gets you all loaded into the bed of his truck to get medical attention.  Bet you wished you had that stupid Life Straw now idiots! You failed the Colorado Trail!

                You decided that you’ll come back another day with friends and water to avoid any possible dangers.  I applaud your common sense!  Come back soon to enjoy the Colorado Trail!!!
